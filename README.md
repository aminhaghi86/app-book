# app-book
In this project, I implemented a CRUD system for managing books,
along with user registration and login functionalities.
Additionally, I integrated JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication, storing tokens in local storage.
For the backend, I used .NET Core and SQL Server, while the frontend was developed using Angular and Bootstrap
